# School-Presidential-Voting-Website

This was a little project I made (never fulfilled its purpose sadly) that was intended to help the school with its electing system. 
Student could see real time updates regarding the presidential candidates messages, their respective profiles, live news updates, a live countdown. 
And most importantly when the time came they could vote using the website.
